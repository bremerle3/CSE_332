Lab0 Solution: cards


This program was tested using the card_file.txt test case file provided in the lab prompt. 
It provides test cases that include case sensitivity and multiple lines in a file.

I also tested the program by entering either no arguments or more than one argument from the
command line in order to test that my usage_fcn helper function could handle these cases and
direct the user to proper usage.
